#**PHP  If/else, switch, logical operators**

##**How to Write Conditional Statements in PHP**
-If, elseif, and else are the only conditional statements available in PhP.
-Any other form of an if-else statement will not work.
-Below is a basic example of an if/elif/else statement.
EX-
● if/elif/else statements 
<?php
$x = 10;
if ($x < 5) {
    echo "x is less than 5";
} elseif ($x > 5) {
    echo "x is greater than 5";
} else {
    echo "x is equal to 5";
}

?>


##**PHP and Short Circut Logic**
-Php does use short-circuit evaluations which is && for And , || for Or and != for Not.
-The boolean values in Php is True and False
-Below are examples of a simple circut logic
Ex 1-
● short-circuit logic 
<?php
$x = true;
$y = false;

if ($x || $y) {
    echo "At least one of x or y is false";
} else {
    echo "Both x and y are true";
}

?>
-----------------------------------------
Ex 2-
<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 8;

if ($x > 0 && $y < 10) {
    echo "Both x and y are true";
} else {
    echo "Both x and y are false";
}

?>



##**Dealing with the “dangling else” problem in PHP**
In Php you can use “if – else if – else” format 
so as to specifically indicate which “else” belongs to which “if”. 
Ex- if(condition) {
}
else if(condition-1) {
}
else if(condition-2){
}
else{
}



##**Twitch Statements in PHP**
-Yes Php does support switch statements.  
-The break statement is required to get out of twitch statements. 
-However, the continue statement is not.
-Below is an example of an twitch statement
Ex-
<?php
$fruit = "apple";


switch ($fruit) {
    case "apple":
        echo "Selected fruit is apple";
        break;
    case "banana":
        echo "Selected fruit is banana";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Selected fruit is not recognized";
        break;
}
