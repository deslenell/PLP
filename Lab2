# PHP: Data types and naming conventions 

##**Discussion questions:** 

##**1. Naming requirements for PHP**
-The naming requirements for variables in PHP is first a variable must start with a dollar sign followed by a letter or a underscore 
-Numbers and special characters such as(&, %, #, or@) are not allowed.
-You should avoid using special keywords= or, name, for, while.
Example - <?php $age = 23; ?> 
		echo  $age;
		(This will print = 23)
    

##**2. The Naming conventions**
-When creating a function name “use underscores between words” and for “class names use both the camelCase and PascalCase rules.”
-Ex- function name=  function curl_close(){ }
       Class name = class WP_HTTP {}
-These rules are enforced by the interpreter.


##**3. Is PHP statically or dynamically typed?**
-Php is a dynamically typed language, you can change the value in a variable.
Ex-  <?php $age = 23; ?> 
       <?php $ age = 23 + 1;?>
		echo  $age;
		(This will print = 24)



##884.Is PHP Strongly typed or weakly typed?**
-Php is a weakly typed language; it does not need to declare the data type when creating a variable.
Ex-When you print $number = "5" + 6;
                   echo $number;
                  (This will print = 11)
The Example shows that an error does not occur!


##**5.PHP limitations (or lack thereof)**
There are no limitations in php programming when creating variables for ints, floats, arrays, booleans. 
However,Php does not have a special character or keyword for creating dictionaries. 
You can use arrays to create something similar to a dictionary.


##**Different DataTypes in PHP**
• int 
<?php
$interger = 8 * 8;
echo $interger;
?>
---------------------------------
• string
<?php
$str = "Hello World!";
echo $str;
?>
-----------------------------------
• floating-point number 
<?php
$interger = 8.5 * 8.5;
echo $interger;
?>
-------------------------------------
• boolean 
<?php
$is_false = 5 > 10;
var_dump($is_false);
?>
-----------------------------------------
• array/list 
<?php
$comic_books = array("invincible", "saga", "black hammer", "far sector");
print_r($comic_books)
?>
